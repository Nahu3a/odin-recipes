        <h2>So, what makes up a Brooklyn pizza? Well, many consider this pizza to be one of the more modern types but closely related to the parent Italia type of pizza</h2>

        <p>Soft stretchy dough you'll think came straight from Brooklyn, NY.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients/h2>

            <ul>
                <li>3 cups bread flour, divided, or as needed</li>
                <li>1 cup warm water</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon active dry yeast</li>
                <li>Â½ teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
            
            <ol>
                <li>Combine 2 cups bread flour, water, yeast, and salt in a bowl with an electric mixer fitted with dough attachment. Mix on lowest speed until blended but still moist, about 2 minutes. Cover with a towel and let rise in a warm place until doubled in volume, about 20 minutes</li>
                <li>Uncover bowl and mix the dough with electric mixer on low speed until dough has pulled together, about 5 minutes. Sprinkle in remaining flour until soft, sticky dough forms, 1 to 2 minutes</li>
                <li>Increase mixer speed to medium and mix until dough pulls away from sides of bowl, about 8 minutes. Cover with a towel and let rest, about 20 minutes. Rub a few drops of olive oil evenly into a plastic container</li>
                <li>Transfer dough onto a floured work surface. Dust hands with flour and knead dough until soft but still wet on the inside. Form into a ball and place into prepared container. Refrigerate dough at least 1 day and up to 7 days</li>
            </ol>
